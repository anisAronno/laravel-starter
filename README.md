### Starting with Docker

To start the Laravel Starter Project with Docker, you can utilize the provided `docker-compose.yml` file. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system.

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  # Define your services here (e.g., nginx, php, mysql, etc.)
  # Example services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    # Add your nginx configurations

  php:
    image: php:8.2-fpm
    # Add your PHP configurations

  # Add other necessary services as required.
```

3. Define the required services such as nginx, php, MySQL, etc., in the `docker-compose.yml` file based on your project's needs.

4. Once the `docker-compose.yml` file is configured, run the following command to start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Access your Laravel application at http://localhost:8000 or the specified port as per your configurations.

## Deploy via FTP with CI/CD

This project utilizes Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for automated deployment via FTP, following GitFlow principles for merge requests.

#### GitFlow for Merge Requests

Follow GitFlow principles to manage merge requests:

- **Feature Branches**: Develop new features in separate branches.
- **Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests to merge features into the `develop` branch.
- **Merge to Master**: Merge from `develop` to `master` for production-ready code.

#### FTP Deployment Process

To deploy your project:

1. Configure necessary environment variables in GitHub Settings:

   - **SERVER**: Your FTP server address.
   - **USERNAME**: Your FTP username.
   - **PASSWORD**: Your FTP password.

2. Upon merging into the `master` branch, GitHub Actions automates deployment to your specified FTP server.

## Laravel Auto Updater

The Laravel Auto Updater feature streamlines the process of updating your Laravel Starter application, making it easy to manage and deploy updates with minimal effort. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

### Features

- Automatically checks for updates.
- Initiates updates with simple Artisan commands.

### Usage

1. **Check for Updates:**
   Run the following command to check for available updates.

   ```bash
   php artisan update:check
   ```

2. **Initiate Update:**
   Use the following command to initiate the update process.

   ```bash
   php artisan update:initiate {version?}
   ```

   Replace `{version?}` with a specific version number if desired; otherwise, it will initiate the update for the latest version.

### Error Handling

Ensure to handle any potential errors during the update process gracefully. Implement logging to monitor any issues that arise during updates.
